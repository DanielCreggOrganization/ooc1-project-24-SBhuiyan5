# OOC1 Project

**Title:** Laptop Application Manager  
**Name:** Sabirina Bhuiyan  
**Student ID:** G00416931  

## Application Function

The main.java file is like the entry point for the rest of the files, I've made a very basic menu using the while loop function which allows users to see a few different options, like for example, I got those options, to add, delete, check total number, search by serial number and to quit the application. The menu stays as a loop until the user selects the quit option.
